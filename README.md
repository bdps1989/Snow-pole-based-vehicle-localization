# Snow-Pole-Based Vehicle Localization
---
This repository implements a **complete, end-to-end snow-pole-based vehicle localization framework** designed to enable **continuous vehicle positioning in GNSS-limited or GNSS-denied environments**, with a particular emphasis on **harsh Nordic winter conditions** where conventional localization cues are unreliable or unavailable.

The framework builds upon **georeferenced snow poles** and **LiDAR–GNSS data fusion**, treating snow poles as **machine-perceivable roadside infrastructure landmarks**. These landmarks remain visible under snow-covered conditions and can be reliably detected using **LiDAR-based perception**, making them well suited for localization when lane markings, traffic signs, and other visual cues are obscured.

By integrating **snow pole detection, snow pole geo-localization, GNSS–LiDAR fusion, data association, and incremental vehicle navigation**, the framework supports accurate **vehicle pose estimation** even during prolonged GNSS outages. This repository implements the localization framework proposed in the IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems paper:

## Overview of the Vehicle Localization Framework

The scope of this repository is to provide a **scalable vehicle localization pipeline** that leverages **georeferenced snow poles as machine-perceivable infrastructure landmarks** to ensure reliable localization in **winter-degraded and infrastructure-sparse environments**.

GNSS measurements provide a global positioning reference when available, while **high-resolution LiDAR data** enable reliable perception of snow poles and continuous motion estimation. By dynamically integrating **snow pole geo-localization** with **LiDAR-based incremental navigation (odometry)**, the framework maintains localization continuity and accuracy across varying GNSS availability conditions.

Together, the components implemented in this repository form a **field-validated vehicle localization framework** suitable for real-world operation in environments where conventional GNSS- or vision-based localization methods often fail.

## Framework Components

### 1. Snow Pole Detection and Landmark Extraction

To support landmark-based vehicle localization in **GNSS-degraded or GNSS-denied environments**, snow pole detection is formulated as a **2D object detection problem** using **LiDAR-derived signal images**.

A **YOLOv5s-based convolutional neural network (CNN)** is employed to detect snow poles from LiDAR signal images[3]. The model is trained on a curated dataset of **1,954 manually annotated images**, covering diverse Nordic winter scenes with varying terrain, visibility, and snow coverage. Annotation quality is ensured through refinement in **CVAT**, improving robustness under visually sparse conditions[2].

Each detected bounding box is mapped back to the corresponding **LiDAR range image** to extract spatial information, including distance and angular position relative to the vehicle. These detections serve as **landmark observations** that anchor the vehicle’s pose estimation process and provide correction points for downstream localization modules.

Extended evaluations across multiple YOLO variants and LiDAR input modalities [4] demonstrate that **multimodal LiDAR representations** significantly improve detection robustness and real-time performance, making the approach suitable for near real-time vehicle localization.



### 2. Snow Pole Geo-Localization

Detected snow poles are first localized **relative to the vehicle** by estimating their distance and bearing from LiDAR observations. These relative measurements are then fused with **GNSS positioning** to compute **absolute (map-level) geolocations**, aligned with pre-measured ground-truth snow pole coordinates at the test site.

This snow pole geo-localization module forms a critical bridge between perception and vehicle localization. By anchoring detected poles to known geographic positions, the framework establishes a **stable landmark reference system** that can be reused across vehicle passes and varying GNSS availability conditions.

Experimental validation is performed using **ROS bag recordings** containing synchronized LiDAR and GNSS data collected on Norwegian highways. Pole geolocation accuracy is evaluated by comparing estimated pole positions against measured ground truth, demonstrating high robustness under winter-degraded sensing conditions.



### 3. Incremental Vehicle Localization and GNSS–LiDAR Fusion


Building upon snow pole geo-localization, the proposed framework[1] estimates the vehicle pose through a combination of GNSS-based positioning, LiDAR-based incremental navigation, and snow pole–based pose refinement.

When GNSS signals are reliable, GNSS measurements provide absolute global pose updates. In GNSS-limited or GNSS-denied environments, the framework employs an incremental navigation strategy based on point cloud registration. In this mode, vehicle motion is estimated by aligning consecutive LiDAR frames, where each incoming scan is registered to the previous one to incrementally propagate the vehicle pose over time.

The core component of this LiDAR-based navigation strategy is the FastReg algorithm [9], a feature-based, hierarchical point cloud registration method. FastReg performs coarse-to-fine alignment by first registering downsampled point clouds and subsequently refining the estimated transformation using full-resolution scans. In our framework, FastReg is employed using its default parameter configuration, owing to its favorable trade-off between registration accuracy and computational efficiency, making it suitable for near real-time incremental navigation. Detected snow poles are subsequently leveraged to correct accumulated odometry drift by registering locally observed snow pole point clouds with their corresponding georeferenced map representations, using the same point cloud registration strategy.

The overall system is modular and registration-backend agnostic, allowing alternative point cloud registration methods—such as ICP, NDT, or learning-based registration approaches to be integrated without altering the overall localization pipeline. By dynamically alternating between GNSS-based localization and LiDAR-based navigation with point cloud registration, the proposed fusion strategy ensures continuous, drift-mitigated, and robust vehicle localization under varying GNSS conditions, particularly in challenging Nordic winter environments.



### 4. Evaluation and Analysis

The vehicle localization framework is evaluated using **real-world data collected under Nordic winter conditions**, covering mountainous, forested, and open road environments. Performance is assessed by comparing predicted vehicle trajectories against GNSS reference paths under varying levels of GNSS availability.

Quantitative results demonstrate that the framework:

- Maintains **reasonable localization accuracy under complete GNSS denial**  
- Achieves **sub-meter accuracy with partial GNSS availability**  
- **Significantly outperforms LiDAR-only odometry method** by leveraging snow pole landmarks  

These results validate the effectiveness of snow poles as **machine-sensible infrastructure** and highlight their role in enabling reliable vehicle localization in winter-degraded environments.



### 5. Relation to the Snow Pole Geo-Localization Sub-Moduley

This repository extends the **standalone Snow Pole Geo-Localization Framework[3]** by integrating it into a **complete vehicle localization pipeline[1]**. While the geo-localization sub-module focuses on accurate **snow pole positioning**, this framework leverages those **geolocated snow poles** to:

- **Anchor vehicle pose estimation**  
- **Reduce odometry drift**  
- **Enable vehicle localization** in GNSS-limited or GNSS-denied environments

## Data Description

The dataset used in this repository consists of **real-world LiDAR and GNSS sensor data** collected along Norwegian highways, with a primary focus on the **E39 – Hemnekjølen test site in Norway**. This test site spans approximately **4.2 km** and includes **mountainous terrain, forested regions, and open landscapes**, making it particularly suitable for evaluating vehicle localization performance under **GNSS-limited conditions and harsh Nordic winter environments**.

The dataset includes the following components:

- **High-resolution LiDAR data** captured using a **128-channel Ouster OS2-128 sensor**, providing full 360° environmental coverage  
- **Continuous GNSS measurements** from dual GNSS receivers mounted on the vehicle, used for initialization, reference positioning, and quantitative evaluation  
- **Georeferenced snow pole locations**, manually measured at the infrastructure level and used as **fixed, stable landmarks** for localization  
- **Synchronized ROS bag recordings** containing LiDAR-derived images, point clouds, and GNSS data required to reproduce the snow pole geo-localization and vehicle localization experiments  

Snow poles are distributed along both sides of the roadway and are designed to remain visible under heavy snow. Consequently, they serve as **reliable machine-perceivable infrastructure landmarks** when lane markings, traffic signs, and other visual cues are partially or fully obscured.
